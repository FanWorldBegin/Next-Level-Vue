Completing our Progress Bar
In the previous lesson we learned how to use Global Route Guards and per-route Guards to implement our progress bar when we show events using the EventShow component. Now let’s build upon that to get the progress bar working with EventList and EventCreate. Both require slightly different implementations.

⚠️ Problem: We need EventList to use our Progress Bar
At the moment our EventList looks like this:



As you can see our progress bar starts and finishes instantly, which is not what we want. We want our progress bar to run and finish when our API call is returned and the data is loaded into the template.

In order to do this, there are a few things we need to do:

Refactor the perPage variable into our state.
Modify the router.js file
Use beforeRouteEnter and beforeRouteUpdate in the EventList component.
Step 1: We need perPage to be in the state
We needed some way to keep track of how many events to display per page, and previously we used a local constant called perPage in our EventList component.

Declaring this.perPage = 3 in our created() lifecycle hook added perPage as a local constant we could access in other methods (like hasNextPage()).

See below, this is the current state of our EventList.vue:

📃 /src/views/EventList.vue

    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    
    export default {
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      created() {
        this.perPage = 3 
        
        this.$store.dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
          perPage: this.perPage,
          page: this.page
        })
      },
      computed: {
        page() {
          return parseInt(this.$route.query.page) || 1
        },
        hasNextPage() {
          return this.event.eventsTotal > this.page * this.perPage
        },
        ...mapState(['event', 'user'])
      }
    }
    </script>
In a minute we’re going to do what we did in the previous lesson inside EventShow, where we moved the Vuex Action outside of the created() lifecycle hook and into a route guard.

Since the route guards run before the component is instantiated, this does not exist yet. So, we need to move perPage into the Vuex State. You might think it belongs in the State, and we never should have put it in the component to begin with. However, there’s nothing wrong with placing it in either place.

📃 /src/store/modules/event.js

    ...
    export const state = {
      events: [],
      eventsTotal: 0,
      event: {},
      perPage: 3
    }
    ...
    export const actions = {
      ...
      fetchEvents({ commit, dispatch, state }, { page }) {
        return EventService.getEvents(state.perPage, page)
          ...
All we changed here is adding perPage to the event State with a default of 3, and then we extracted the state parameter from the context object, and used the State inside our getEvent's call. We also added a return to our EventService so we can only render our EventList component when the API call is finished.

That’s our next step:

Step 2 - Modify the router
At the moment, our router code looks like this:

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList
        },
        ...
Here we want to dispatch the fetchEvents Action before the component is loaded like we did with EventShow with beforeEnter.

With all we’ve learned, you might think the code below would be what we need. However, 🛑 This won’t work! Take a look at this code below, and then we’ll learn why it won’t work.

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          beforeEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) {
            const currentPage = parseInt(routeTo.query.page || 1)
            store
              .dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
                page: currentPage
              })
              .then(() => {
                ...
If I were to use this code to call fetchEvents it would only get called when the route is initially loaded. Then when we hit the next page link, nothing would happen. ****Our route gets updated when we click on the next page, but since the component is not completely reloaded, fetchEvents doesn’t get called.

So we need another way to ensure fetchEvents is called both when the page is navigated to, and when we paginate.

For now, let’s finish up the code we need in router.js by setting props: true because we’ll be setting our current page as a parameter to pass in as a prop.

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          props: true // We'll set the page parameter, so we want to send it in as a prop
        },
        ...
Step 3 - Use beforeRouteEnter and beforeRouteUpdate in the EventList component
From our lesson on In-Component Route guards we learned that beforeRouteEnter is called when the component is created and beforeRouteUpdate is called when the route changes, but we’re still using the same component. This is what we need to ensure fetchEvents is called when we paginate.

Since both beforeRouteEnter and beforeRouteUpdate need to essentially call the same code, I’m going to extract this duplicate code into a function at the top of our EventList component, like so:

📃 /src/views/EventList.vue

    <script>
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    import store from '@/store/store'
    
    // Moved the current page & action call outside the component
    function getPageEvents(routeTo, next) {  
      const currentPage = parseInt(routeTo.query.page || 1)
      store
        .dispatch('event/fetchEvents', {
          page: currentPage
        })
        .then(() => {
          // pass it into the component as a prop, so we can print next pages
          routeTo.params.page = currentPage
          next()
        })
    }
    export default {
      props: {
        page: { // current page gets passed in as a prop
          type: Number,
          required: true
        }
      },
      components: {
        EventCard
      },
      beforeRouteEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) { // Before we enter the route
        getPageEvents(routeTo, next)
      },
      beforeRouteUpdate(routeTo, routeFrom, next) { // Before we update the route
        getPageEvents(routeTo, next)
      },
      computed: {
        hasNextPage() {
          return this.event.eventsTotal > this.page * this.event.perPage
        },
        ...mapState(['event', 'user'])
      }
    }
    </script>
We’ve changed a bunch in this file from before (if you want to look at the before, scroll up).

First, you’ll notice that we extracted our currentPage parsing code and Action call into a function called getPageEvents. We call this function from our beforeRouteEnter and beforeRouteUpdate route guards. These fire before we enter a route and before we update the route, which solves our problem of our Action only called once with beforeEnter.

You’ll also notice that there’s now a page prop, which contains the current page we’re on, parsed and passed in through getPageEvents.

If we jump into the browser, everything is working as intended: The Progress bar flows across the top of the screen when we view the event list, and also works when we use the pagination links.



😏 You might have noticed:
We didn’t remove Vuex from the component.

Before we move on, I want to recognize that we did not remove Vuex from our component code in EventList, like we did with EventShow. We certainly could have passed EventList all of the props it needed to load through the router, like so:

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'event-list',
          component: EventList,
          props: route => ({
            page: route.params.page,
            perPage: route.params.perPage,
            events: route.params.events,
            eventTotal: route.params.eventTotal
          })
        },
        ...
However, we don’t have to go down this road, and set all these values. We already had to load in Vuex inside EventList for beforeRouteUpdate and beforeRouteEnter, so we can keep the Vuex code the same.

Again, this is a matter of preference.

⚠️ Using the Progress Bar with EventCreate
When someone clicks submit on our EventCreate page, once again we need to make sure the Progress Bar starts, to ensure a good user experience. Updating this only requires adding NProgress to EventCreate.

Our EventCreate currently looks like this:

📃 /src/views/EventCreate.vue

    <script>
    import Datepicker from 'vuejs-datepicker'
    
    export default {
      ...
      methods: {
        createEvent() {
          this.$store
            .dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event)
            .then(() => {
              this.$router.push({
                name: 'event-show',
                params: { id: this.event.id }
              })
              this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
            })
            .catch(() => { })
        },
        ...
We need to do two things here. We need to start the progress bar before we dispatch the event shown here, and we need to stop the progress bar if our Action errors out.

📃 /src/views/EventCreate.vue

    <script>
    import Datepicker from 'vuejs-datepicker'
    import NProgress from 'nprogress' // <--- Include NProgress
    
    export default {
      ...
      methods: {
        createEvent() {
          NProgress.start()  // <-- Start the progress bar
          this.$store
            .dispatch('event/createEvent', this.event)
            .then(() => {
              this.$router.push({
                name: 'event-show',
                params: { id: this.event.id }
              })
              this.event = this.createFreshEventObject()
            })
            .catch(() => {
              NProgress.done() // <-- if errors out stop the progress bar
            })
        },
        ...
As you can see, we’re just starting the NProgress bar and stopping it if we error out. When the Action is successful, we still use the router to push to the EventShow view, just like we were before.

When our router follows this path it will call NProgress.start() again. But since it’s already running, nothing new will happen and it will finish loading once the fetchEvent action is complete.

Here’s it working.



⏪ Let’s Revue
We now finished implementing our progress bar in our example app, and if our API calls ever take a while to return our user interface gives a great user experience.
