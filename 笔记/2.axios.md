Progress Bar: Axios Interceptors
Isn’t it frustrating when you click on a link and nothing seems to happen? The Internet isn’t always fast (or dependable), which is why it’s important to design user-friendly applications that give feedback when parts of your webpage are still loading. In this lesson and the next four, we’ll install a progress bar, and show a few different ways to control it in a Vue application.

In this video we’ll show one way to implement a progress bar by:

Installing NProgress
Using Axios Interceptors
🛑 Problem: Our API calls might not always be super fast
We need to let our users know the data is on the way, and have something happen when they click a link that requires an API call.

If you’re building the event app alongside us, just know that after we install the NProgress bar, we’ll be showing you three different ways to implement it.

Axios interceptors (in this lesson)
In-component route guards (next lesson)
Global and per-route guards (lesson after that)
Each of these solutions are 100% worth learning, as they’ll teach you additional Vue syntax.

☑️ Solution #1: Progress Bar using API Interceptors
There are many ways to implement a progress bar, and we’re going to start with the simplest one. This one doesn’t even require you to use Vuex.

As I mentioned, we’re going to use NProgress, a progress bar library, inside our app. Let’s install it from the command line, though I could also have used the Vue CLI user interface:

    $ npm install nprogress
Now that we have NProgress installed we need to include the CSS for it inside our main.js:

📃 /src/main.js

    ...
    import store from './store/store'
    import BaseIcon from '@/components/BaseIcon'
    import 'nprogress/nprogress.css' // <-----
Using Axios Interceptors
In our example app our API calls are all made inside EventService, and all use the Axios library.



Axios Interceptors allow us to intercept our requests and responses adding additional functionality, like starting and stopping a progress bar as shown below:



As you can see, we call NProgress.start() to start our progress bar and NProgress.done() to finish the animation. As you might imagine, Axios Interceptors can be useful for many things including:

On request to set proper authorization tokens.
On response to format or filter data before it reaches into your app.
On response to catch 401 not authorized responses.
Let’s figure out how to use Interceptors in our example app. Our EventService currently looks like this:

📃 /src/services/EventService.vue

    import axios from 'axios'
    
    const apiClient = axios.create({  // The single Axios instance we use for calls
      baseURL: `http://localhost:3000`,
      withCredentials: false, // This is the default
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    
    export default {
      getEvents(perPage, page) {
        return apiClient.get('/events?_limit=' + perPage + '&_page=' + page)
      },
      getEvent(id) {
        return apiClient.get('/events/' + id)
      },
      postEvent(event) {
        return apiClient.post('/events', event)
      }
    }
Adding Axios Interceptors to our code looks like this:

📃 /src/services/EventService.vue

    import axios from 'axios'
    import NProgress from 'nprogress' // <--- Import the library
    
    const apiClient = axios.create({ ... })
    
    apiClient.interceptors.request.use(config => { // Called on request
      NProgress.start()
      return config
    })
    apiClient.interceptors.response.use(response => { // Called on response
      NProgress.done()
      return response
    })
    
    ...
As you can see, Axios interceptors act like middlemen (or middleware) allowing you to run some code when a request is made, or when a response is received.

Before we jump into our browser to check it out, we need to simulate a slow API server. We are using json-server as a development API and our application ships with a db.json file with fake data. If you haven’t installed it, you can get it by running npm install -g json-server. We’ll run our API server with:

    $ json-server -d 1500 db.json
With the -d 1500 the API server will add a 1.5 second (1,500 millisecond) delay before returning our data. Now in our browser we see that our progress bar ticks along for 1.5 seconds, before completing the request and populating our data.



This is a valid solution and may work great for you, but there are two caveats you should be aware of.

😕 Caveat #1 - Not optimal for multiple API calls at the same time

This works great until we are using two or more API calls to load a page. In this scenario we’d want to continue to show the progress bar until all API calls return. A common solution to this problem is to create a loading Vuex module that holds the loading State. Here’s what that might look like:



If you’d like to continue down this road, you might want to check out this post for another example implementation (Yes, the post is in TypeScript, but it’s still quite readable even if you’re not familiar).

😕 Caveat #2 - Templates get rendered before the API call is returned

On some webpages, it’s not a great user experience to see the page before the data is populated in it reactively. You’ll notice when we load up /event/5 (an event that we have to pull from the API) that the page loads empty before the data flashes onto the screen 1.5 seconds later.



This is NOT an optimal user experience since the user sees the page broken before they see it working.

Over the next two lessons we’ll work towards a solution that solves for both of these issues. First, we’ll learn about In-Component Route Guards and then using Global with Per-Route Guards.
