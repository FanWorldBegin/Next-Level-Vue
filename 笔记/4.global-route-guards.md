Global and Per-Route Guards
In this lesson we’ll learn how to use Global and Per-Route Guards to provide a progress bar when our application has slow internet API calls. This is the official solution we’ll be using in our example app, so now would be a great time to download our example app and get it up and running if you want to follow along.

Getting the App Setup (optional)
Here are the commands you’ll want handy once you have it installed. I’m assuming you already have npm installed.

To install dependencies:

    $ npm install
To get json-server, which we use for our mock database

    $ npm install -g json-server
To run the mock database (with a 1.5 second delay)

    $ json-server -d 1500 --watch db.json
To run the server:

    $ npm run serve
🛑 Problem: Our API calls might not always be super fast
The problem we’re trying to solve is still to account for the internet not always being fast. Right now when we view an event here’s what we see (and what you should see):



As you can see, it looks kinda broken. The template is loaded blank, and then the data pops in.

☑️ Solution #3: Global and Per-Route Guards
For this solution, we’ll be starting from scratch again, so we’ll need to install the NProgress library:

    $ npm install nprogress
And then add the NProgress stylesheet as an extra import statement:

📃 /src/main.js

    import 'nprogress/nprogress.css'
Then we’ll use two new Global Route Guards inside our router.js and make the progress bar appear on every page of our app.

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
    import EventShow from './views/EventShow.vue'
    import NProgress from 'nprogress' // <--- include the library
    
    Vue.use(Router)
    
    const router = new Router({ ... })
    
    router.beforeEach((routeTo, routeFrom, next) => {
      // Start the route progress bar.
      NProgress.start()
      next()
    })
    router.afterEach(() => {
      // Complete the animation of the route progress bar.
      NProgress.done()
    })
    
    export default router
As you can see, now we’re storing our router in a router constant, and calling two Global Route Guards which start and stop our progress bar on each route. In case you’re wondering what order all these hooks get called, it looks like this:



If we go into our browser we can see this on every page, and it almost works like we want it:



As you can see, the progress bar finishes loading before our API gets loaded, just like before! We need a way to not load the component onto the page until it’s done loading, and only then finish the progress bar.

We need another Route Guard for this, and we could use beforeRouteEnter in our EventShow component, but I’m going to solve this a different way. This time I’ll use a Route Guard inside our router, rather than inside our component.

📃 /src/router.js

    ...
    import EventShow from './views/EventShow.vue'
    import NProgress from 'nprogress' 
    import store from '@/store/store' // <--- Include our store
    
    Vue.use(Router)
    
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/event/:id',
          name: 'event-show',
          component: EventShow,
          props: true,
          beforeEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) { // before this route is loaded
            store.dispatch('event/fetchEvent', routeTo.params.id).then(() => {
              next()
            })
          }
        }
      ] ...
By including our Vuex Store and using the Per-Route inside our router.js we can dispatch our fetchEvent Action (that we normally would call from our EventShow), and only once that’s returned will we allow the navigation to continue by calling next(). However, in order for then() to get called when the API is returned we need to make sure this action returns a promise (we did this once before in the previous lesson if you’re following along):

📃 /src/store/modules/event.js

    ...
      fetchEvent({ commit, getters, dispatch }, id) {
        var event = getters.getEventById(id)
        if (event) {
          commit('SET_EVENT', event)
        } else {
          return EventService.getEvent(id) // <--- Add return here 
            .then(response => {
              commit('SET_EVENT', response.data)
            })
            ...
Now that we’re calling the Action from our router, we no longer need to call it from our EventShow action. This file shrinks a bit:

📃 /src/views/EventShow.vue

    ...
    <script>
    import { mapState } from 'vuex'
    
    export default {
      props: ['id'],
      computed: mapState({
        event: state => state.event.event
      })
    }
    </script>
And if I look in the browser, everything is working as expected:



In case you’re wondering, here’s the calling order:



🏗️ Architectural Choice: Removing Vuex from our Components
Before we move on to the other components, there’s some fun refactoring we could do to this EventShow page. We could completely remove Vuex from EventShow, and send in event as a prop from our new Per-Route Guard. Our EventShow component ends up shrinking a lot:

📃 /src/views/EventShow.vue

    ...
    <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        event: {  // Simply receive the event to render
          type: Object,
          required: true
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    ...
Yeah, that’s it. Awesome huh? It’s now just a component that renders a single prop that is passed in. How does it get passed in? See below:

📃 /src/router.js

    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      routes: [
        ...
        {
          path: '/event/:id',
          name: 'event-show',
          component: EventShow,
          props: true, // Set params to props
          beforeEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next) {
            store.dispatch('event/fetchEvent', routeTo.params.id).then(event => {
              routeTo.params.event = event // <--- Set the event we retrieved
              next()
            })
          }
        }
In the code above, we now take the event which is returned and set it to the value of routeTo.params.event. Then after next() is called. Since props: true is set for the component, params.event gets sent in as the event prop, like we were doing with id before.

Notice how our then callback now has an event parameter, which is filled by the event that returns from the API. To make sure the value gets sent in the callback, we’ll need to add two returns to our event Module:

📃 /src/store/modules/event.js

    ...
      fetchEvent({ commit, getters, dispatch }, id) {
        var event = getters.getEventById(id)
        if (event) {
          commit('SET_EVENT', event)
          return event // <--- Added return here
        } else {
          return EventService.getEvent(id)
            .then(response => {
              commit('SET_EVENT', response.data)
              return response.data  // <--- Added a return here
            })
Now when our fetchEvent Action is called, it returns our event so our router can send it into EventShow as a prop. Pretty nifty, huh? It works just the same, but now the EventList component has one less dependency, making it easier to test and scale.



⏪ Let’s Revue
In this lesson we learned how to use both Global Route Guards and Per-Route Guards which get called upon navigation before our component is created. These can be very useful when we need to fetch data from an API, or when we’re doing any type of authentication. In the next lesson we’ll finish up this implementation, building our progress bar into both our EventList and EventCreate components.
